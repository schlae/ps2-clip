# 3D Printable IBM PS/2 Clips
Several IBM PS/2 computers use plastic clips to hold various parts of the computers together. These clips come in two pieces: a plunger and a plastic clip.

Sadly, the clips have a weak point and the little "wings" tend to break off.

If you've had this happen to you, don't fret! I have made 3D-printable models of these parts so you can make your own replacement clips.

The bottom part is the one that breaks the most often, but I've also modeled the plunger itself just in case you need one of those.

## Printing Notes
If you are using an FDM printer, set it to the highest quality for best results. I typically print with the axis of the part aligned to the Z axis (think of a chesspiece or a tower).

After printing, use a sharp knife to clear out any excess filament stuck in the four slits at the end of the clip.

## Assembly Notes
Insert the plunger. You may need to clamp it in a vise to push it through and bend the "wings" out slightly. Then remove the plunger.

Like other fasteners, this clip is designed to hold two objects together. The clip is held captive in the first object when the plunger is inserted halfway. This spreads the "wings" out far enough to keep it in place but still allows it to be inserted into the hole in the second object.

Then, when the plunger is pushed in all the way, it spreads the "wings" out all the way and creates a friction fit with the second object.

To separate the two objects, pull the plunger out about 1/8" (3mm). IBM provides a little plastic tool inside the computer's case to make this easier.
